1. Design an application which is able to find the alphabet of a given sequence. 
The alphabet means the unique symbols from which the sequence is made
Eg. sequence S="ATTGCCCCGAAT" find the alphabet of the sequence.

2. Design an application which is able to calculate the relative frequencies of each symbol from the
alphabet of the sequence. Use the same sequence as before

3. Use the AI to design an application with a GUI that is able to integrate your algorithm from
assignement 1 and 2. Your application must have a button which allows the user to choose a Fasta File.
Fasta Files contain a specific biological format. The output should be shown on the main window by using
a text box object or something similar. Fasta Files have the following format:
 I. The first line is the information line that shows the ID of the sequence, the species and other of info
 II. Starting from the second line we have the raw sequence which can be DNA, RNA or proteins that is split
in 80 character lines until the end of the file
Use the AI to simulate a fasta file for your input
